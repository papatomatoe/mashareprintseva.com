No artist tolerates reality, finding the way to speak about vital, urgent, striking and painful topics in the most eloquent language. For quite a long time this part of my creative universe was hidden from the public. I considered this as my healing place, free from criticism, bans and restrictions. By expressing my strong emotions with fibre and textile I calm them down, cope with disorders, ask myself questions and try to answer honestly, explore and go on a journey without leaving a place where I am.

For me, this is an expression, intimate conversation, allegory, grotesque. Here I arrange intricate topics I cannot discuss widely, so I “write a letter to myself” simply stitching the issues and transforming them into the textile.
