Have you ever thought that geometry is the archetype of the beauty of the world? You may find it in the humming of the strings, twists of threads in canvas, threading beads of various forms and their spacing, or the polygons of crystal cuts. Isn't it a geometrical equilibrium that draws the soul toward the revelation of truth and creates the spirit of philosophy?

Like drawing lines and corners, dividing a triangle with a bisector, I set the tubes of matte and glossy bugles into my monochrome "geometry" of the fabric weaved pattern.

I arrange them into squares, contour with shiny satin cubes - the prevailing geometry shapes in our planet and, according to Plato's theory - cubes make the universe, being the prototype for the majority of all fragmentation patterns and solid matter found on the Earth.

In our world, we are surrounded by cubes and cuboid formations. These geometric shapes are natural and rather primitive phenomena. Just have a look at crystal systems like pyrite, calcite or multi-element compounds such as caesium chloride and rock-salt structures. Divinely beautiful, superbly built and designed. They seem to be made by man, as modern houses, built of glass and concrete.

Apart from stone forms, human surroundings are filled with non-organic cubic setups. The majority is man-made: houses, rooms, furniture, accessories and packaging, is the representation of the geometry that exists in our mind.

We acquire this sense of space by observing the organic world, and we apply this knowledge to our own little world through creation.

Humans are likely to perceive cubic forms as non-natural structures, regarding them as a representation of order, rationality and intelligence, but not as a key construction part of the Universe.

This bespoke dress may seem strict but reflects a touch of holiday glow. It is "composed" of a delicate Italian suiting jacquard (silk/wool) and raspberry-red silk lining, which hides a true sensuality under a steel "defence". The dress features dolman sleeves (with a gusset, counter fold and the central seam) and symmetric hand-embroidered embellishments on a fragmented waistband (sewn into the pleats) and the cuffs.

The embroidery collates the woven pattern of the fabric. It decorates the waistline on the sides of the front and the vertical edges of the cuffs. The cuffs have pairs of sew-in snap-fasteners. The central seam on the back contains a tiny hook, a zipper and a vent. The embroidery is made of TOHO beads: bugles (matte and gloss hematite), triangles, hexagons and cubes (dark silver, black, gun-metal).
