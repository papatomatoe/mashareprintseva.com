From little things, big things grow. The story of the Enchanted Wood represents the symbols of fertility and immortality, as well as a reminder that humble beginnings can bring great results. Acorn and pomegranate, growing in the tree of life, the tiny bird perched in its branch, the blooming hibiscus and sunflower, a ripe raspberry are around two magical creatures.

Acorn and pomegranate, growing in the tree of life, the tiny bird perched in its branch, the blooming hibiscus and sunflower, a ripe raspberry are around two magical creatures.

At first glance, they seem alike, but if you watch the embroidery at another angle, the colour changes. The creatures look different, like day and night, male and female. Different by their nature - they were created to be together.

Gold, silver, copper, bronze, silk, pearls - are in one story. Being rather conservative about using metals of different colours in one story, here I like how the shine of various shades accompanies one another in the Enchanted Wood, like the hearts of magical creatures. They walk together between the magical trees, promising to have and to hold, from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and on health, to love and to cherish. They will keep the glow in each other for life, letting small things grow.

I used silk and rayon threads, bullion wire, crystals, pearl and metal sequins, freshwater pearls. In some areas, I did the padding with cotton thread to achieve the necessary volume. A couple of parts were boned with wire and embroidered separately. After, I assembled them in one piece.

The arrangement of the stitches in some parts of the design serves to make an impression that embroidery is changing colour. I do this "trick" so that the light plays on the surface, creating depth and intensity. I lay the silk strands "radiantly" like, to resemble the sunbeams or guilloche on metal. Just slightly change the angle of observation and notice how it works.
