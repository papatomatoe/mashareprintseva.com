This is a game that grabs you in the first second. It has is a sustainable approach to up-cycling of different textile scraps and threads. It gives an amazing volume of designs to create and transform. Simply by switching on the imagination, dyeing the fabric and threads with organic dyes or, using ready-made ones, you may create unique pieces to use as decorative elements. For me, it is a wonderful journey to go together with a child. A chance to discover new crafts and materials, and some new ways to use them. Driven by imagination such activity enchants to tell stories about mysterious Far-away-land and fairytale heroes, creatures, and animals.

I consider this series of albums to be a very special one, magical, driven by some childish questions, interests, and impressions. The designs for the albums were done in a real Montessori play through which the variety of the materials, shapes, and textures were used. Some of the albums became a keepsake not only for family photos but also for some lovely treasures being pleasant to touch and quite interactive to play with.

In some albums, I apply the traditional techniques, images, and symbols. They represent a fusion of textile illustration, symbolism and the means of embroidery we got used to.
