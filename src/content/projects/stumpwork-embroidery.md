The desire to try and master various embroidery became my passion a long time ago. At first, I imagined and thought of how some stumpwork embroidered pieces are made. I had no idea how to apply this method and where to use it. Once, watching the birds playing in the tree I saw them quite inspiring and made my first stumpwork embroidery that was a bit challenging, but very exciting!

Some of the albums decorated with 3d embroidered elements and stumpwork embroidery became very special for me. Some of them were the first albums I used padding, wire (as "bone" element). Some of the albums in this series became special to their owners. I appreciate it!

In some designs for the albums, I used traditional botanical images. I boned them with wire, stitching, and shaping, giving the volume and quite a real look. Some flowers were stitched with hand-dyed threads that helped to achieve the most natural colour palette.
