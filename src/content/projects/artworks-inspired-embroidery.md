With my deep respect and acknowledgement to the great masters of art, I make my mind and hands busy with embroidering the images of some works they created on their life-being. For me, it is the way to understand their emotions and expressiveness, not only by reading about their works, life and creativity, sometimes the absence of support, misunderstanding of the surroundings and the hardship of emotional disorders. It is the way to imagine being in their shoe, facing and experiencing the same.

Every time I make an embroidered piece driven by some marvellous rhythm of Klimt's painting, Van Gogh's desperate palette, Sigmar Polke's ironical strokes, I feel like I am experiencing certain trouble of my own, a kind of creativity search, sensual disaster or hardship of emotional "bleeding", that get healed by the patience sustaining, balancing the world inside with an outside “picture” and getting some strength to overcome creativity crisis having a needle and embroidery frame in the hands.
