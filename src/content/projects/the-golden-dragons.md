Long ago, a huge braid of golden koi was swimming up the Yellow River. Gaining strength by fighting against the current, fish glimmered as they swam together through the river. When they reached the waterfall, many of the koi turned black, and the river carried them away. The remaining koi refused to give up. Leaping from the depths of the river, they tried to reach the top of the waterfall, but to no avail. Their efforts caught the attention of local demons. They mocked their efforts and heightened the waterfall out of malice. After a hundred years of jumping, one koi finally reached the top of the waterfall. The gods recognized the koi for its perseverance and determination and turned it into a golden dragon, the image of power and strength.

Koi fish are associated with positive imagery. As the dragon legend tells us, they are known as symbols of strength and perseverance. As seen, their struggle through the upstream was the way to the fulfilment of their destiny. Resulting from its bravery in swimming upstream, often koi fish is associated with Samurai Warriors in Japan.

The symbolism of koi differs due to the colouration of the fish. Black koi represents masculinity and its patriarchal role. Gold koi symbolize prosperity and wellbeing in business. Blue koi, often associated with the role of the son, represents tranquillity. Red koi represent strength and power. It also is recognized as the matriarchal koi. Whatever the legend or colour, koi fish will always carry a positive weight. Whether it be good fortune, longevity, perseverance, or courage, the koi fish encompasses it all.

For me, Koi is a graceful creature. Its beauty and melancholic movement in the water nail the attention. Its muteness is its wisdom. Its colour is its honour and glory. Its legend is a model of persistence for some of us in our hectic days or despair. At last, koi is just a beauty some seek to capture, arranging silk stitches on fabric, or making it out of precious metals, encrusted with gems or other splendours.

My Koi keeps a whisper of a magical spell. They strike the eye and seem real, slowly moving in the black pond, diving into the water, gently moistening their sides. Their tails and fins glimpse, leaving the circles on the water, while green "plates" of pond greenery stay resistant to the fish play, swaying in a meditative dance.

A pure delight and a calm enjoyment for any artist or a philosopher, intensified by an enthralling sense of action and endeavour!
