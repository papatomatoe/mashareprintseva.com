Nature, as represented by a variety of species, types and structures, unveils its world in a dreamy dance where colours and textures play their solo parts. It inspires humans to make marvellous designs, to capture the look of nature's wild blossoming on a textile surface.

The mind transforms this picture into the sensual sensation of Nature. Organic resources serve to realise the work, becoming threads, fabrics and dyes – referencing the natural "roots".

The iconic and recognisable New Look silhouette by Dior is influential in the construction, emphasising femininity and the natural beauty of the body. The delicacy of fabrics blending with the complexity of texture, materials and techniques, create an effect whereby the floral corset wraps the waist, presenting the female as the gem of the bouquet.

It reflects an imaginative colour subsistence as seen through my eyes, this feeling of the connection between Nature and human, and the freedom, consciousness, beauty and deep care for the natural resources granted to us.
