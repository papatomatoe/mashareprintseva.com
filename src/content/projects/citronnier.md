If we dive into any book dealing with botany, it will go without saying that lemons inspired botanists incredibly much. At the same time, they discovered the beauty of lemon trees, lemon blossoming and lemon fruits, indulging with sparkling taste and exquisite flavour. Lemon, being surrounded by other savours brings out the best in their neighbours: lifting the most delicate tastes, naturally timing the bolder.

As historians say, citrus trees were first introduced into Europe after the Indian conquests of Alexander the Great and continued to arrive via the Silk Road and Spice Route from China spreading across Southern Europe in the Middle Ages. The 'golden apples of Hesperides', lemons have been associated for centuries with weddings, marriage and love.

The citrus tree has long fascinated botanists with the ability to bear fruit every day of the year, as well as bearing fruit simultaneously with blossoms. Furthermore, to grow your citrus tree, all you need is one plant – that’s because multiple citrus types can be grown just on one tree.

In cuisine, lemon is the third seasoning after salt and pepper. It balances sweet and savoury dishes. Lemon oil, zest and flower essences are a perfect marriage, in perfumery with thousands of other scents. In Art History lemon also has significance.

The image of a lemon allegories sourness and bitterness, while the peeled lemon in a still-life symbolises ephemerality and time passing.

Everlasting ejection of lemon prints into summer seasonal collection is a classical approach carried by iconic Cristian Dior (Galliano period), Dolce & Gabbana and Oscar de la Renta fashion houses.

Contemporary brands, like NaSoPerfect, Cara Cara, Zara, and Loewe also have lovely citrus patterns featuring lemons in their archive of in-house designs and vintage-inspired prints.
In the Victorian language of flower arranging, lemon blossoms meant discretion while lemon fruit is considered a symbol of longevity, love, and friendship.

If you are passionate about embroidery, I welcome you to try creating this juicy and fresh branch of a lemon tree to be framed and used as interior decoration. You may also use my example of using embroidery motifs for decorating a finely-sewn blouse, which pockets and yokes are lined with natural silk habotai.

The concealed button placket does not distract the eye from the key elements of the front. French seams inside, and decorative hand-stitching, done with silk thread along the collar, cuffs and armhole — add a lovely touch to every part of this relaxed yet rather classic shirt. Golden buttons on the cuffs and collar shine the same bright as lemons — they sing summer prelude.
