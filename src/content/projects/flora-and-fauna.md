Being a child, I had a book that excited me most of all. It was an illustrated Atlas of Biology. Flipping its glossy pages, I looked at the beautifully painted plants and admired their structure and parts. I examined their seeds, petals and leaves. I watched a lush plumage of rare birds, dreaming to see them in flesh. I adored the sumptuous complexity of an amazing animal world and, a breathtaking variety of herbs, flowers, insects and other tiny creatures. Their rich colours and textures are the source of my inspiration today. The equilibrium they represent I try to perform in my animalistic and floral embroideries.

I liked to "hide" in some virgin rainy forests displayed in the book by amazingly painted watercolour illustrations and "walk" in the mountains among the unique examples of blossoming, ferns and moss.

I have brought this love to my adulthood, trying to express it through embroidery. I adore the works of the British School of Botanical Illustration, the artworks by Pierre-Joseph Redout√©, Pierre-Antoin Poiteau, Jeanne Holgate. I find them the most inspiring.

Flowers and birds are quite inspiring for any artistic expression. They demonstrate a rich variety of colours that you strive to imitate, mastering your embroidering skills stitch by stitch, trying to recreate the amazing palette formulated by nature.
