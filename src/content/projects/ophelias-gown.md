What if Shakespeare would have given Ophelia a chance to stay alive? What if the love story could have been developed? What if the main heroes would have let their relation some intensity?

The image of Ophelia is outstandingly lyric and full of symbolism and metaphors. She, being one of the principal heroes in the narration represents marvellous femininity being innocent. Her madness is her treasure and her curse— her own way to display wisdom and faithfulness.

The image of violet is a metaphor that keeps her sadness, dreams, and hopes, deep shades of purple reveal her sorrow and pain.
