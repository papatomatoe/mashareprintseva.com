On thinking about the idea for this dress I imagined a traditional expression of female beauty, which is gathered from the shape of an hourglass, a dancing layered skirt which keeps a seductive secret and the petals of blooming flowers blown with the wind.

There are many different techniques applied for making. The flower design is hand-stitched with cotton, silk and metal threads. The flowers are made of silk organza, shaped and gathered by hand, accompanied by meditatively swaying moss-green feathers.
