Female beauty enchanting and impressive gift which leads the creativity of various artists since ancient times. Feminine shapes, complexions, and proportions are typically compared to natural creations like gemstones and flowers.

On thinking about the idea for this dress I imagined a traditional expression of female beauty, which is gathered from the shape of an hourglass, a dancing layered skirt which keeps a seductive secret and the petals of blooming flowers blown with the wind.

There are many different techniques applied for making. The flower design is hand-stitched with cotton, silk and metal threads. The flowers are made of silk organza, shaped and gathered by hand, accompanied by meditatively swaying moss-green feathers.
