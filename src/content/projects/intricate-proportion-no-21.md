If we observe the general theory of relativity as a fundamental scientific discovery of the XX century (which inevitably embraces other adjoint areas of science, where scholars typically develop Einstein’s ideas) we will get an understanding of many ordinary things around us in a bit modified way — powdered with a “pinch” of science where no science itself has been expected at all. How much does that ”pinch” weigh? What does the pinch contain? What sort of pinch is that pinch?

Each pinch, in any case, is relative to the time, conditions and the one who makes it. The average mass of any matter fallen onto the surface forms a triangular pyramid weighing one gram, however, even that means nothing in the changing context.

While falling, the matter of a pinch comes into the curvature of space-time, the substance of the "pinch" is “free” while it is sprinkled down off the fingers, because, as it is known from the general theory of relativity: the motion of a free body does not depend on its mass. Mass characterizes the behaviour of the body only under the action of forces.

According to Einstein's theory, gravity - is not a force, it is a curvature of space-time. When a pair of fingers sprinkle the pinch of some matter, the only influencing force is friction. However, mainly, it does not influence the substance and its physical characteristics of the matter (a pinch of something), it changes the conditions around it.

Through the practical experiment, I have received various results which depend on many factors, the kinds of matter and the conditions. Measuring the pinch of sugar, salt, soda, flour, starch or even the mixture of them, the pinch itself appeared different each time, as well as the quantity of the leftovers, stick to the fingers (which depend on friction force, raising the temperature, humidity, skin perspiration and other factors which no doubt, slightly modify the pinch, but leaving its mass quite close to the etalon one gram).

Through the experiment, no theory was born, but it proved a tricky supposition that declares a pinch of whatever real matter - as a quite relative and not exact proportion, measurement, quantity which inevitably varies due to the curvature of space-time, friction force (which changes the surrounding conditions), anthropogenic factors. But if it appears interesting for you, think about "pinch" as a metaphoric substance, an allegory of figuratively used matter. The issue becomes even more relative in such cases, driven and regulated only by the common sense and game of imagination.
