An embroidery of a landscape, in the beginning, seemed extremely complicated for me. I thought that a perfectly stitched view of a seaside or mountain means a very high skill. I used various techniques before I find the best one and succeeded. Patchwork, chenille, appliqu√©s, satin stitching, needle painting, etc. were my ways of getting enough depth and texture in many landscape embroidery projects.

While waiting till the embroidery in my hands became perfect I lost sight of the idea that the best way to make a landscape embroidery "shine" is to express the feeling you have throughout the work but not imitate anything. Just like the way great impressionists did it, their masterpieces and their perception became very influential on me. Now I see it as a key element, stitching the views as I feel them, getting some sensual impression not a real state of things.
